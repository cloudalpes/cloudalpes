### About the template
 
Project Zeppelin allows you to setup awesome GDG DevFest site in 5 minutes. It's built on top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - simple, blog-aware, static site generator. Jekyll also happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, which means you can use Jekyll to host your website from GitHubâ€™s servers for free. [Learn more about Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Template is brought by [GDG Lviv](http://lviv.gdg.org.ua/) team.

## Local development

Check if you have [all requirements for local environment](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
To install all development dependencies install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) and run next command from root folder:

```bash
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
```

To start Jekyll run (jekyll serve -w) or use ./run_webserver.sh:
```bash
    ./run_webserver.sh
```

Site will be available at http://127.0.0.1:4000/ or http://localhost:4000/ (on Windows)
